## How to run a Rust program.
### For windows only
1. Go to terminal.
2. Enter the command "rustc .\hello_rust.rs".
    - rustc is for Rust compiler which will compile [hello_rust.rs](hello_rust.rs) file.
3. It will generate following files if is executed successfully.
    i. [hello_rust.exe](./hello_rust.exe) (Here [hello_rust.exe](./hello_rust.exe) is an executable file which can be run from terminal)
    ii. [hello_rust.pdb](./hello_rust.pdb) (Won't be able to see it coz it is ignored by git. [hello_rust.pdb](./hello_rust.pdb) is the second file which consist all the debugging information.)

4. Now to execute the the program enter the command ".\hello_rust.exe".
5. And it will prompt the output "Hello, Rust!" on the screen.
