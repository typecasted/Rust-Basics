# Variable and Mutability
- Variables are **immutable by default** in Rust for memory safety.
- To make a variable mutable, use **mut** keyword. 
- We can also make a variable constant by using **const** keyword.
- There's a concept known as **Shadowing** by which variable's value and data type can be changed.
